# 👋 Hi, I'm Inno (Innosensius Sachio)

🎓 International student from Indonesia  
📍 Studying Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Cybersecurity  
🏫 University of Technology Sydney (UTS) | 🎓 Graduating December 2026  
🛡️ Specializing in Offensive & Defensive Security  

---

## 🧠 About Me  
I'm passionate about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and secure network design. I work on real-world labs and simulations involving:
- Network attacks (DNS spoofing, ARP poisoning, SQL injection)
- Intrusion detection systems (Snort IDS)
- VPNs (IPSec), TLS/SSL, firewall configuration
- Digital certificates and X.509 PKI  
I also explore platforms like **Hack The Box** to build practical skills.

This GitHub is where I share my **projects, lab work, and study notes** as part of my ongoing learning and development.
